# killer-bunnies

A game built to submit to a [Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-community-jam). This is a top-down twin stick shooter game with survival elements. The goal is to protect your farm at all costs from the wildlife and other dangers. The theme of the Game Jam is “Time”. We incorporate time through the time it takes to get through each round of enemies. Each round will last a certain amount of time. Between each round, the player will have a short period of time where they can add upgrades. There is no end objective and the game will go on until you get overrun. The game is built using BabylonJS.
